          <p>The hotel madras grand is clean and tidy with good staff and quite attentive as well, the only issue is the time up they have done in terms of food. The don't have an in-house restaurant and the person delivering from outside does not care about time constraints or availability. And the food is not edible at all. I never had a chance to have breakfast so can't comment on that. Hotel over all is good.</p>
