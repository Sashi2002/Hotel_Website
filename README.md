### ABSTRACT

This project focuses on creating a website for a hotel. The website is built with HTML and CSS. It focuses on providing the customer with all of the information they need about the hotel and its amenities. 
The website provides accommodation details with photos and also has a customer feedback system. Many hotel websites lack suitable feedback or client complaint redressal forms. The goal of this project is to provide a customer assistance system.

### INTRODUCTION

A central and top-level management functioning web application-based system has replaced the previously relatively obscure printed banners and manual customer service during the last few decades. 
This transition has been impacted by a variety of elements, including professionalism, technology advancements, and the widespread acknowledgment of people as the most valuable resources. <br>

A computer-based management system is made to manage all the essential data needed to display room information, among other things. One of the things that draws the user or client is a list of all the amenities and services. 
This project aims to improve user usability in a number of processes, including hotel search, room booking, client feedback, and hotel location retrieval. The entire feedback information will be mailed to the hotel admin for further response generation.<br>

This project examines a variety of website requirements for hotels and aims to take it a step further by making visitors feel welcome. Every project should aim to create a user-friendly, engaging user interface, and this project succeeds in doing just that. This project is majorly based on HTML and CSS.

### METHODOLOGY

#### a.	HTML    :
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web. 
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

#### b.	CSS.  :
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.
CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. 
This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.

#### INNOVATION AND CONTRIBUTION TO THE PROJECT

1. Unlike the majority of the typical hotel website, this project offers opportunities for online client feedback.
2. The project's results assist the customer in making informed accommodation selections and in obtaining a variety of information about amenities and locations, all of which are crucial considerations before a guest books a hotel.
